What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

->   A repository is a folder which keeps record of all the version of given files in it.
We need it for future use.For example, if we want to look up a change we made to the file
in the past.It helps us explore our new ideas with more confidence without the fear of 
breaking the code.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

->    It falls in b/w the two.It contains the files which have not yet been committed.
It allows us to decide the number of files we want to choose to be in a single commit.
