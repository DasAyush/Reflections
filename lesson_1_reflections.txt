How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug 

that 
was introduced?


->   It compared the before and after texts and helped us find out the 

changes.



How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?


->   It would help us in comparing two or more versions of the same file over a period of time.
    

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like 
Google docs does?

->   It helps us to choose when to commit a file and so,only a necessary version of a file would be committed.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving
multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

->   By reducing the number of commits, it helps the users in browsing through the history of files where 
changes in one file affect the other files too.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

->   'git log' shows us the history of commits whereas 'git diff first_id second_id' shows the 
changes that were made in first version to obtain the second version of the file.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

->    To checkout which bug was introduced in which commit.It gives us a comfort zone where we can
rest assured that our earlier working version is still secure on the system.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

->    I will write all my codes by using Git to keep track of all my commits.
