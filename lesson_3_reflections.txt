When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

->  A remote repository can be used when we want to collaborate with others on our 
project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
 stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

->  It is because we might not want all of the changes made in the remote repository
 to be updated in the local one or at the same time.
