When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

->  A remote repository can be used when we want to collaborate with others on our 
project.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

->  It is because we might not want all of the changes made in the remote repository
to be updated in the local one or at the same time.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

->  Forks is a concept that belongs only to GitHub.It is used to create a copy of an existing repository
on others' accounts onto our account.(Since,we do not have permission to make changes into the original repository)

Clones are copies of repositories in 3 ways-(i)Same computer
                                            (ii)From our computer to a server
                                            (iii)From the server to our computer

Branches are created when we want to make more than one version of an existing file in the
repository with a different approach.
